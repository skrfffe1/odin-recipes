    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This classic baked <strong>mac and cheese</strong> recipe with a buttered bread crumb topping is creamy and comforting. It's easy to make the cheese sauce from scratch on your stove top, starting with a roux and adding milk, Cheddar, and Parmesan, resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook and cranny of the noodles. Serve this comfort-food macaroni and cheese casserole with grilled meats, sloppy Joes, fried chicken or alongside a salad for a meatless dinner.</p>
